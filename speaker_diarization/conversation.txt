So why'd you come to see me today? Uh, it's just my left foot's been hurting really badly and it hasn't been getting better. And I tried taking ibuprofen but the pain doesn't go away. I see what's, uh, the pain level? Uh, definitely. Uh, seven. Yeah. Every time I walk it really hurts. Interesting. OK, umm, could you show me which foot? Uh, right here, this one, this one, yeah. And what were you doing that caused it to be in this pill? I might have like maybe jump from a high height, too high and then the pain started it Sometimes it goes away, but sometimes the pain goes back. 

As well, sometimes it goes away and sometimes the pain comes back. That's pretty interesting. OK, alright, interesting. Umm. 

Well, just take this medication and maybe some over the counter medication like Tylenol and. Umm, ibuprofen. Maybe that'll help it go away. If not then we will follow up and take. But I'm already taking ibuprofen well at that point. Let's reschudule.
